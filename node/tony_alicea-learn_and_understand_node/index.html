  <h1>Learn and understand node.js - Tony Alicea</h1>

  <h2>Lecture 4: The command line interface</h2>

  <h3>Big word: Command Line Interface</h3>
  <p>A utility to type commands to your computer rather than clicking</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bash on Linux</li>
    <li>Terminal on Mac</li>
    <li>Command Prompt on Windows</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Big word: Arguments</h3>
  <p>Arguments are values you give to your program that affect how it runs. <br>
  Essentially passing paramenters to a function</p>



  <h2>Lecture 6: Processors, Machine language and C++ (V8 JavaScript engine)</h2>

  <h3>Big word: Machine code (or Machine language)</h3>
  <p>Programming languages spoken by computer processors. <br>
  Every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code</p>
  <p></p>



  <h2>Lecture 7: JavaScript Engines and the ECMAScript Specification</h2>
  <h3>Big word: ECMAScript</h3>
  <p>The standard JavaScript is based on. How the language should work.<br>
  ECMAScript is needed a standard since there are many engines, other than V8</p>

  <h3>Big word: Javascript Engine</h3>
  <p>A program that converts Javascript code nto something the computer processor can understand. <br>
  And it should follow the ECMAScript standard on how the language should work and what features it should have.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 8: V8 under the hood</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 9: Adding features to JavaScript</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 10: Servers and Clients</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 11: What does Javascript need to manage a server</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces</li>
    <li>Ways to deal with files</li>
    <li>Ways to deal with databases</li>
    <li>The ability to communicate over the Internet</li>
    <li>The ability to accept requests and send responses (in the standard format)</li>
    <li>A way to deal with work that takes too long</li>
  </ul>



  <h2>Lecture 12: The C++ core</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 13: the Javascript Core</h2>
  <h2>Lecture 14: Downloading Lecture Source Code</h2>



  <h2>Lecture 15: let's install and run some Javascript in Node</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Break point</h3>
  <p>A spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution of our code. <br>
  So we can figure out what's going on...</p>



  <h2>Lecture 16: Modules</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Module</h3>
  <p>A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code. <br>
  Javascript did not have this before.</p>

  <h3>Big word: CommonJS modules</h3>
  <p>An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 17: First-Class functions and function expressions</h2>
  <h3>Big word: First class functions</h3>
  <p>Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions. <br>
  You can use functions like strings, numbers, etc. (i.e. pass them around,
  set variables equal to them, put them in arrays, and more).</p>

  <h3>Big word: Expression</h3>
  <p>A block of code that results in a value <br>
  Function expressions are possible in Javascript because functions are first class.</p>

  <h3>Big word: Invoke</h3>
  <p>It means run the function. <br>
  We also say "call" the function.</p>



  <h2>Lecture 18: Let's build a module</h2>



  <h2>Lecture 19: Objects and object literals</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Name/Value pair</h3>
  <p>The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given <b>context</b>.<br>
    That value may be more name/value pairs. <br>
    (you also know them as key / value pair or properties of objects)</p>

  <h3>Big word: Object: A collection of name/value pairs</h3>
  <p>The simplest definition when talking about JavaScript.</p>

  <h3>Big word: Object literal</h3>
  <p>name/value pairs separated by commas and surrounded by curly braces</p>



  <h2>Lecture 20: Prototypal inheritance and Function Constructors</h2>
  <h3>Big word: Inheritance</h3>
  <p>One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object</p>
  <h3>Big word: Function constructors</h3>
  <p>A normal function that is used to construct objects. <br>
  The "this" variable points a new empty object, and that object is returned
  from the function automatically.</p>
